To generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT), follow these steps:

1. Log in to GitHub:
Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
2. Access the Developer Settings:
In the upper-right corner of any GitHub page, click your profile picture, then click Settings.
Scroll down and on the left sidebar, click Developer settings.
3. Generate a Personal Access Token:
In Developer settings, select Personal access tokens from the sidebar.
Click on Tokens (classic), then click Generate new token.
Give the token a note so you can remember why you created it, for example, "Git CLI Token."
4. Select Scopes and Permissions:
Select the scopes or permissions you'd like to grant this token.
For full access to repositories (push, pull, etc.), select the repo scope.
You may also want to select workflow for GitHub Actions or admin:repo_hook for repository webhooks.
For the minimum necessary permissions, select only what you need.
5. Generate the Token:
After selecting the scopes, click Generate token at the bottom of the page.
6. Copy the Token:
Once generated, copy the token immediately. You wonâ€™t be able to see it again after you leave the page.
7. Store the Token Safely:
Store the token in a secure place (e.g., a password manager).
Use the token instead of your password when performing operations like pushing or pulling from a GitHub repository.
Using the Token with Git:
When prompted for a username and password during Git operations, use your GitHub username as the username, and paste the token as the password.

For example, when you push or pull, Git will ask for credentials:

```
Copy code
Username: your-github-username
Password: your-access-token
```
And that's it! You can now use the token for GitHub authentication with Git and other tools that interact with GitHub.
