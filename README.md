# üåê EASY!!! - `AWS S3-Hosted Website CI/CD` - EASY!!!

This project provides a super easy solution for hosting a static website on Amazon S3, using a DevOps workflow, IaC & GitHub Actions for automated deployment and updates. **All you need is a domain and a hosted zone!**

**Note:** *All of the code was created with the assistance of **Amazon Q***

## üîÑ Workflows

### üÜï Deploy Site
Manually triggered or comment-triggered workflow to deploy the website.

- **How to Trigger**: Trigger this workflow through the GitHub Actions tab or by adding a comment like `deploy-site` on a commit and push it to origin.

### üîÑ Update Site
Automatically updates the **S3 bucket** and invalidates the **CloudFront distribution** when changes to the `website-prod` directory are pushed to the `main` branch.

- **Note**: Ensure environment variables such as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` are set in your GitHub repository secrets for proper CI/CD functionality. See [GitHub Secrets Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) for details.

### üóëÔ∏è Destroy Site
Manually or comment-triggered workflow to tear down the website infrastructure.

- **How to Trigger**: Trigger this workflow through the GitHub Actions tab or by adding a comment like `destroy-site` on a commit and push it to origin.

## üîß Configuration Steps
1. **Set-up AWS User**
   .
2. **Set GitHub Repo Secrets**

1. **Prepare Environment**  
   Set up your local development environment or use a cloud environment like Gitpod. Learn how [HERE!](https://github.com/Warner-Bell/Easy-Dev-Env-Setup/blob/main/README.md)

2. **Clone Repo**  
   Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Warner-Bell/AWS-S3Hosted-Website-CI_CD.git
    ```

    Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd AWS-S3Hosted-Website-CI_CD
    ```

3. **Edit Config File**  
   Update the configuration file (`config.sh`) with the correct values such as **S3 Bucket Names**, **Domain Name**, **Hosted Zone ID**, etc.  
   See [CONFIG_SETUP.md](https://github.com/Warner-Bell/AWS-S3Hosted-Website-CI_CD/blob/f070c8c586f654f576928a14680486e3005c005b/CONFIG_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

4. **Edit Credentials File**  
   Edit the `.credential-file` to include your GitHub token and username, then rename it to `.credentials-file.env`.

5. **Edit `website-prod` Directory**  
   Use the provided **Demo Site** or replace the demo files in the `website-prod` directory with your own HTML, CSS, and JS files. Ensure your file structure aligns with the project setup for smooth deployment.

6. **Test Locally**  
   Test your changes locally. Use a tool like `http-server` to serve your static files for local testing:

    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    http-server ./website-prod
    ```

7. **Commit Changes**  
   Commit all the changes you made to the repository:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your New S3 Website"
    ```

8. **Create Remote Repo**  
   Create a Remote Copy of your customized repository on GitHub by editing the `REPO_NAME=` variable in the [create-remote-repo.sh](https://github.com/Warner-Bell/AWS-S3Hosted-Website-CI_CD/blob/966af9c5136f472f4341ea60cd545249307d1344/create-remote-repo.sh) file, then run the script.

9. **Push Changes and Deploy Site**  
   Commit your changes:

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "deploy-site"
    ```
   Push your changes to trigger the deploy workflow:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
